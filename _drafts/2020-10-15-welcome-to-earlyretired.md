Hello, future Tribemember,

If you are new here, Stop reading just now!! I would strongly encourage you to go and read about what FI/RE actually is and why you should at least know about it [here]({{"/early-retirement/" | relative_url }}).

Why are you still reading?? :angry: Go read the above link first, you dummy!!

Good!! :kissing_heart: So now we are friends.

I can safely assume that you are one of the many proponents of the FIRE movement, and like me, you also want to be FI/RE _Financially Independent and Retire Early_.

## About Me

I am Nitigya, I am one of the 4.3 million people employed in India's IT sector. I am a Computer System Engineer, who is in pursuit of Financial Independence and plans to retire early.

I do not have 15 years of functional experience as a financial advisor, nor I have done any professional course on personal finance. I am an ordinary, but skeptical person, with serious trust issues and therefore I do not take any advice on the internet without any data. So should you.

I like reading and writing. Finance has been my second interest after computers.

## Why am I blogging?

Since I have started my journey for financial independence, I have come across many interesting topics, articles, and books. I have been bookmarking, taking notes,  making calculations, and running simulations for my own.

I always like writing about things that I have learned and applied successfully. Although most of my writing has been in the form of documentation and README files. Recently I  started writing articles on medium and found that I enjoy that. 

That's when I thought of starting my own blog to write about stuff. 

But, why I am writing about financial independence and early retirement?

There are atleast 10k people who want to retire early in India. Which is a very small number compared to 800k of the total FI/RE followers.<sup>1</sup>

It was really interesting for me,  that a country that has close to 20% of the world population has only 1.2% total FI/RE population. I spread more awareness about FI/R realized that there is a gap here, that needs to be filled. People in India must see a world where life is just not about work, but living too.

**What does this blog about**

As you might judge from the name of the blog, it is obviously about the early retirement, but it's not limited to that, I also write about other things that surround the whole FI/RE buzz.
