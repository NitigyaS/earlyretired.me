Hello future Tribemember,

If you are new here, Stop reading just now!! I would strongly encourage you to go and read about what FI/RE actually is and why you should at least know about it [here]({{"/early-retirement/" | relative_url }}).

Why are you still reading?? :angry: Go read the above link first, you dummy!!

Good!! :kissing_heart: So now we are friends.

I can safely assume that you are one of the many proponents of the FIRE movement, and like me, you also want to be FI/RE _Financially Independent and Retire Early_.

## About Me

I am Nitigya, I am one of the 4.3 million people employed in India's IT sector. I am a Computer System Engineer, who is in pursuit of Financial Independence and plans to retire early.

This my first time blogging, So obviously I am going to make a lot of mistakes, but what is the worst thing I can get,  except feedback?

I like reading a lot, I read about so many things

## Why am I blogging?

Well, Since I have started my journey for financial independence, I have come across so many interesting topics, articles, and books. I have been bookmarking, taking notes, doing making calculation, and running simulation on my own. 

I found that I have enought data, but not formally organized anywhere,  

There are atleast 10k people who wants to retire early in India. Which is a very small number compared to 800k of the total FI/RE followers.<sup>1</sup>

It is really strange to see that a country which has close to 20% of world population has only 1.2% of total FI/RE population. I believe this to be an opportunity to spread more awareness about FI/RE and let other see a world where life is just not about work, but living too.

Since I started this journey of mine, I have came accross varisous books, blogs, people who have exapnded my way of thinking and has given me a completly new prespective of life. I have learnded so much and still learning and wanted to share this with the world.

**What does this blog about**

As you might judge from the name of the blog, it is obviously about the early retirement, but it's  not limited to that, I also write about other things that surrounds the whole FI/RE buzz.
