Hello, fellow Tribe member,

If you are one of the newcomers to this whole FI/RE movement, I have a news for you. You remember the 4% withdrawal rule that the best selling author tells you about.

Well, that doesn't work in real life. :frowning:

I know, I know that you should not trust anything without the data.

#### Let's talk about the data first.

So here, I have fetched the data from January 1991, and I have retired one person every month, with a net worth of ₹100.

<ul class="is-style-arrowmark-list">
<li>The portfolio is made up of 70% of equity and 30% debt.</li>
<li>Consumer Price inflation = 5%</li>
<li>Average return on debt = 7%</li>
</ul>

Since the data is from about 1991, Dataset is small, For example, Trinity study had almost 30 years of data, but in India, the actual data start from only around 1991.

So yes the data set is small, but that doesn't stop us right?

### How many survived this short retirement period?

I have assumed here that **anybody who depleted his corpus to ₹0 or less, has basically failed in FI/RE game**. Therefore the failure criteria is very low and it is really difficult to reach it, but simulation does reach that target. This is almost the same what the trinity study did.


| SWR% | Success% |
|:-------:|:----:| 
|  2%   | 100%  | 
|  2.5% | 100%  | 
|  3%   | 100%  |
|  3.5% | 97%   |
|  4%   | 88%  | 
|  4.5% | 72%  | 
|  5%   | 60%  |

This means that to make sure that your corpus does not reach to ₹0 you should have a withdrawal rate of at least 3%

Here you can see, that at 4% SWR, only 88% of the population was able to survived.

### Result, Why 12% failed at ₹0

I bet you are asking the same question, How the hell it is possible, that only 88% of the population was able to survive this short amount of time. That too when the benchmark was only a **0** ? This benchmark is very linient, but it will do a good comparison with the Trinity Study.

Well first let's see, who died in this test.

In the above data we can see that all those people who retired, just before a major market crashed failed. Also chances of failure increases if your withdrawl rate is high.

### Conclusion
Frankly there is no conclusion, this report is not complete, it is far from reality. In real life **0** can not be our benchmark.

This post will have multiple parts and you can read about them here

* [FIRE : Withdraw only from debt, if market is crashing!]({{"/withdraw-from-debt/" | relative_url }})


Yes, that's going to be brutal and alot more people will die.
