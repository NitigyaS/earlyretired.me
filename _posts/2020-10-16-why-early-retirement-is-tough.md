Hello fellow Tribemember, 

Forget about the stories that best selling author tells you in their best selling book, Ignores the blog post that says you can safely live on your corpus, if your living expense is less than 4% of your total corpus, Neglect all those self acclaimed people who say they have retired early and are living their dream, and listen to me :wink: (Pun intended!)

Let's put our critic's hat and see why early retirement is tough, but not impossible. It is possible, but I just wrote the title that way to get more clicks. You know how tough the competetion is? :smiling_imp:

Let's burst some myths and get our facts aligned.

### Early retirement is achivable and people are doing it.

This is true, this is achievable and yes people are doing it, but how many have been successful at this.

But, everyone who sits for an exam doesn't necessarily pass it, atleast not without preparation.

To understand the above anlaogy, let's first see the history of the FIRE. this primarly kicked of in 1992 with Vicky Robin's book "Your money or your life" and got popular around the 2008's market crash.

Basically, most of the people who have retired early have retired less than 2 decades ago. Even if they retired at the age of 45 in 2010, today they will be around 55 years old and there retirement corpus still has to last for atleast next 30 years.
 
### Retirement corpus can last forever with 4% SWR.
The above line is so eye cathing that we mostly forget to cross check the facts.
This was the result of Trinity study done on the data set from 1925 - 1995, which states
"If history is any guide for the future, then withdrawal rates of 3% and 4% are extremely unlikely to exhaust any portfolio of stocks and bonds during any of the payout periods shown in Table 1. In those cases, portfolio success seems close to being assured."

According to study extremely unlikely means 95%, and payout period was only 30 years. cough cough.

Times have changed, the real rate of return is diwindeling to single digit levels and life expectancy is increasing therfore 30 year i\*s only suitable for those who are retiring at age 60.

### Post retirement stress disorder.
If you are thinking that after retirment all of your worries will vanish in thin air, you are definetly wrong. Retirement comes with it's own stress, to name a few :

* Fear of exhausting the corpus.
* Lacking a sense of ‘self’ and identity.
* Not being able to financially help your immediate family.
* infirorty complex due to low (and obvious) standard of living.
* Not having enough to do all day.

If not planned properly early retirement could be your life's biggest mistake. That's the reason, I have meet so many people who can't even imagine stop working. forget about early retirement , they have no plans to retire even in 60s.

### Retirement is cozy
When we see the advertisement of retirement from insurance companies, we feel that life will sail smooth after retirement, but thre are so many uknown event that can happen, that will throw your retirement plans in jeopardy.

* Criticall illness.
* Majror Market Crash or recession.
* Disability.
* Death of a dear one.
* Economory breakdown.

There is always the fear of unknown and not everything can be planned, A Recent example of this is the Covid - 19 Pandaemic.

### You can go to work anytime
This one is true, If you invest in your skills, they will stay with you forever. Although one can theortically always go to work again after a short retirement period, but practically it is a little tough.

For starters, You will have to massively upskill yourself, to be part of the workforce again. You might not get the next work opportunity in the same location, You might not even get in the same profile. After years of gap, the pay scale won't be as good as it used to be.

**Conclustion Time**

Don't worry, we are going to tackle all these problem one by one, by making smart and educated moves.

Retirement is tough but not impossible, With proper planning, preparation and timing we can crack it. True, that there are not of people who have done it, but there are plenty of those, from whom we can learn.

There is a huge community and everyone is helpful and full of knowledge.
