Hello, fellow Tribe member,

If you are one of the newcomers to this whole FI/RE movement, I have bad news for you. You remember the 4% withdrawal rule that the best selling author tells you about.

Well, that doesn't work in real life. :frowning:

I know, I know that you should not trust anything without the data.

#### Data

So here, I have fetched the data from the January 1991, and I have retired one peson every month, with a net worth of ₹100.

Portfolio is made up 70% of equity and 30% debt.

Consumer Price inflation = 5%

Average return on debt = 7%

Let's see how they have performed.

Here you can see, that at 4% only 88% of the population was able to survive.
