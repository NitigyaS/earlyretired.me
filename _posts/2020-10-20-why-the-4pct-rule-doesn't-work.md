Hello, fellow Tribe member,

If you are one of the newcomers to this whole FI/RE movement, I have bad news for you. You remember the 4% withdrawal rule that the best selling author tells you about.

Well, that doesn't work in real life. :frowning:

I know, I know that you should not trust anything without the data.

#### Let's talk about the data first.

So here, I have fetched the data from January 1991, and I have retired one person every month, with a net worth of ₹100.

* The portfolio is made up of 70% of equity and 30% debt.
* Consumer Price inflation = 5%
* Average return on debt = 7%

Since the data is from about 1991, Dataset is small, For example, Trinity study had almost 30 years of data, but in India, the actual data start from only around 1991.

So yes the data set is small, but that doesn't stop us right?

### How many survived this short retirement period?

I have assumed here that **anybody who depleted his corpus to ₹0 or less, has basically failed in FI/RE game**. Therefore the failure criteria are very low and it is really difficult to reach it, but simulation does reach that target. This is almost the same what the trinity study did

| SWR in % | Success %  |

 |-------|----| 

|  2%   | 100%  | 

|  2.5% | 100%  | 

|  3%   | 100%  |

 |  3.5% | 97%   |

 |  4%   | 88%  | 

|  4.5% | 72%  | 

|  5%   | 60%  |

This means that to make sure that your corpus does not reach to ₹0 you should have a withdrawal rate of at least 3%

Here you can see, that at 4% SWR, only 88% of the population was able to survive.

### What the fuck?

I bet you are asking the same question, How the hell it is possible, that only 88% of the population was able to survive this short amount of time. That too when passing marks was a whole **0** ?

Well let's see, who failed this test.
