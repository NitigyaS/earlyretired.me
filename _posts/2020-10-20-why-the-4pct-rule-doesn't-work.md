Hello, fellow Tribe member,

If you are one of the newcomers to this whole FI/RE movement, I have bad news for you. You remember the 4% withdrawal rule that the best selling author tells you about.

Well, that doesn't work in real life. :frowning:

I know, I know that you should not trust anything without the data.

#### Data

So here, I have fetched the data from January 1991, and I have retired one person every month, with a net worth of ₹100.

* The portfolio is made up of 70% of equity and 30% debt.
* Consumer Price inflation = 5%
* Average return on debt = 7%
* Let's see how they have performed.

Here you can see, that at 4% SWR, only 88% of the population was able to survive.

### What is survival?

I have assumed here that anybody who depleted his corpus to 0 or less, has basically failed in FI/RE game. Therefore the failure criteria are very low and it is really difficult to reach it, but simulation does reach that target.

| SWR in % | Success %  |
|-------|----|
|  2%   | 100%  |
|  2.5% | 100%  |
|  3%   | 100%  |
|  3.5% | 97%   |
|  4%   | 88%  |
|  4.5% | 72%  |
|  5%   | 60%  |
