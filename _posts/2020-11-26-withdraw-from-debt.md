In the last post I did the simulation of 4% rule and found that only 88% people have succeeded during last few years in Indian Market.

Poor souls, we just killed them :cry:. But, why they had to die? :thinking:


:bulb: In the wall of shame shared in the last post, We can see that mostly those people died, who retired just before a market crash.
Thinking on this for a second, we can see that they died because they withdraw money when the corpus was weak.

Well, A simple strategy, that most people share is to withdraw only from debt, when market is crashing.

Let's see if it can work?

### Survival Strategy : Withdraw from Debt only
If we can start with a corpus of Equity and Debt and only withdraw from Debt when market is down?

**Assumptions** 

<ul class="is-style-arrowmark-list">
<li>Starting corpus consists of 50% equity and 50% Debt</li>
<li>Return on Equity =  Inflation (6%)</li>
<li>Return on Debt =  4% + Inflation (6%)</li>
<li>Starting value = 100.</li>
<li>Yearly spend = 4%</li>
<li>Spending increases every year, due to inflation (6%)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<table >
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Year</th>
			<th>Spend</th>
			<th>Debt</th>
			<th>Equity</th>
			<th>Total Corpus</th>
			<th>Ideal Value</th>
            <th>Loss</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>50</td>
			<td>50</td>
			<td>100</td>
			<td>100</td>
            <td>0%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>4.24</td>
			<td>50.76</td>
			<td>53</td>
			<td>103.76</td>
			<td>106</td>
            <td class="text-warning">2.16%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>4.49</td>
			<td>48.30</td>
			<td>55.12</td>
			<td>103.42</td>
			<td>112.36</td>
            <td class="text-warning">8.65%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>4.76</td>
			<td>45.46</td>
			<td>57.32</td>
			<td>102.79</td>
			<td>119.10</td>
            <td class="text-danger">15.87%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>5.05</td>
			<td>42.23</td>
			<td>59.62</td>
			<td>101.85</td>
			<td>126.24</td>
            <td class="text-danger">23.95%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>5.35</td>
			<td>38.57</td>
			<td>62.00</td>
			<td>100.57</td>
			<td>133.82</td>
            <td class="text-danger">33.06%</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


We can see that if the equity recovers from Crash in year say 3, Corpus will have to grow by 16%, If the crash continues for 5 year, it will need a growth of 33% to keep you alive.

**33% , That's a lot!! :scream: :scream:**


From the above small simulation we can see, that unless your corpus is not able to give 4% above the inflated value even withdrawing from debt will not be able to save you. 

## What is next?
Reader of this blog are very intelligent, and will be quick to find a flaw in the above model.
This is not true to reality. In reality if market is crashing normally expense reduces, because people stop spending money on outregeous activities like eating into costly restaurants, or watching movies in cinema every weekend.


We should run these numbers assuming that the expense of the retiree reduces too if market crashes.
We will cover that in the next post
