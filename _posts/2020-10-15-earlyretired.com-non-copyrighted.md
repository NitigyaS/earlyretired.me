Hello fellow Tribemember,

On January 11, 2013, Aaron Swartz hanged himself to death in his apartment, He left no sucide note, but the reason was known to the whole world.   

He was convicted to download large number of document's from MIT's open network and Nine other felony, For this he was given two options by the state prosecutor.

1. 50 years of jail and $1 million of fine.
2. Plead guilt for 13 federal crime and identify as a criminal.

Aaron being a hacktivist could not accept these charges and decided to end his life.
 
He was only 26 year old when he did this, Aaron had contributed a lot to for the development of internet. He contirbuted to the Markdown publishing format, that I use to write the article on this blog and is being used by all the developer world wide to crate documents, RSS feed revolutionizing how people used internet and also participated in Creative Commons in early stages.

It is difficult to imagine a collaborative and thriving blogging community without these.

In a world where politicians and big business man destroys the whole natons and billion of dollars in days and hours, Aaron was killed just because he downloaded and distributed the academic papers.

## My repsects to Aaron
