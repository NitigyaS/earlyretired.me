Hello fellow tribemember,
I noramlly assume that almost all the tribemember who read the blog, would be familiar of the concept of FIRE (Financially Dependent , Retire Early).
But, assuming something, is aginast the rile of our FIRE tribe.
So I thought of writing this article for those, who are just thinking of becoming the part of the tribe, or maybe just wondering what this all about.

First of all, before you continue, ask yourself these questions :

* How do you feel about waking up daily at 8:00 for office and returning home at 7:00.
* How do you feel about sleeping in your house and living in the office.
* How do you feel notifying to everyday, when you take a leave, or in worst case, to ask for permission to take a leave.
* How do you feel about the things you wanted to do as kid or younger self, are still waiting in your journal to be crossed.
* How do you feel when you live paycheck to paycheck, always running after someting new and shiny.

If your answer was good, I strongly encourage you to write your experience in the comment section and tell us more about it.
Otherwise you are also one of us, who thinks there is more to life than to work and wait for death.

Any normal person normally plans to work till 60s and than retires. Although the retirement age is so reicuclaly high that till the point you reach retirement your body had already stop most of it's functioning.

Eyes become week, bone densitiy reduces and muscel mass decreases. With years of grinding in the cubicle, body achess, back pains, knee hurts. Those of us who are working a whitecollar jobs, are affected the worst, since ther dormant lifestyle renders their body useless. There si not much left to life after that except to wait patiently for the death.

At this point you realized that Capitalism fucked you, you kept working and working to amass wealth and increase your networth, selling products, writing presentation , pleasing bosses and clients, that you forgot why you wanted to earn money at the first place,

The capitalist industry politely asked you to retire, becuase now you were essentially useless to them, How can you live now, when you can't even work, the days that were meant to live were spent in the box and now when you are out of the box, it is too late. 

even you we think we can live a life after retirement, it is going to be a very short one, 20 years if you are stay healthy, fit and lucky.

FIRE says that you can retire earlier, say at 45 or 40 , hell I have heard of stories of people retiring at 31 too.
The logic is that if you can live off the 4% of your net worth you will never have to work again.
So simple, right? Wait, untill it is not. read about **Why early retirement is impossible** 

Goal of Fire is to spen most part of your life living it and working for only the time which is required.

In this blog, I noramlly write about, I write about mimalism, frugality, early retirement, finacial independence and other interesting topics.
