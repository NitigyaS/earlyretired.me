Hello future tribemember,


Stop reading just now!! If you are new here, I would strongly encourage you to go and read about what FI/RE actually is and why you should at least know about it.[here]({{"/early-retirement/" | relative_url }}).

What you are still reading??

Go read the above link first, you dummy!!

Good I will safely assume that you are one of the many proponents of the FIRE movement, and like me you also want to be Financially Independent and **Retire Early** .


If you a typical person who spends 70% of his day in office? Do you think you are part of the rat race? Are you bored with your currentl life and wants to live before you die.


But, if not I would strongly encourage you to go and read about what FI/RE actually is and why you should at least know about it [here]({{"/early-retirement/" | relative_url }}).

There are atleast 10k people who wants to retire early in India. Which is a very small number compared to 800k of the total FI/RE followers.[source reddit community count] ;p

It is really strange to see that a country which has close to 20% of world population has only 1.2% of total FI/RE population. I thought this to be an opportunity to spread more awareness about FI/RE and let them see a world where life is just not about work, but living too.

But, like me you might also be womdering if early retirement is so simple. Can I really get out of this rate race? Can my retirement corpus will last forever? Is early retirement is for me? What will I do if I retire? Worry not my friend as I also do not know the ansewers of all these questions.

But, You and me can find these answers.

Anyways, we can't afford to jump into early retirement without a full proof plan. Right?

So, sail with me on the adventure to early retirement and beyond.
Together we will achieve early retirement the correct way.
