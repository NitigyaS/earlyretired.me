Hello, future Tribemember,

If you are new here, Stop reading just now!! I would strongly encourage you to go and read about what FI/RE actually is and why you should at least know about it [here]({{"/early-retirement/" | relative_url }}).

Why are you still reading?? :angry: Go! Read the above link first, you dummy!!

Good!! :kissing_heart: So now we are friends.

## About Me

I am Nitigya, one of the 4.3 million people employed in India's IT sector. I am in pursuit of financial independence and plans to retire early.

I do not have 15 years of functional experience as a financial advisor, neither I have done any professional course on personal finance. I am a suspicious person with serious trust issues, who do not take any advice on the internet without any data. So should you.

I like reading, writing and finance have been my second interest after computers.

## Why am I blogging?

Since I started my FI journey, I have come across many exciting topics, articles, and books.

I always like writing about things that I have learned and applied, although most of my writing has been in the form of documentation and README files. Recently I started writing articles on medium and found that I enjoy that.

That's when I thought of starting my blog to write about stuff.

**Why am I writing about financial independence and early retirement?**

There are at least 10k people who want to retire early in India. A small number compared to 800k of the total FI/RE community.<sup>1</sup>

It is interesting to note, that a country, which makes 20% of the world population has only 1.2% of the total FI/RE population.

With the help of the blog, I can spread more awareness regarding the whole FIRE buzzword as well as will be able to connect better with others.

very interesting

## What I am going to blog about?

As you can guess from the name of the blog, it is obviously about early retirement, but it's not limited to that. I also write about other things that surround the FI/RE buzz.
