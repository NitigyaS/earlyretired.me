Hello future Tribemember,


If you are new here, Stop reading just now!! I would strongly encourage you to go and read about what FI/RE actually is and why you should at least know about it [here]({{"/early-retirement/" | relative_url }}).

Why are still reading?? :angry: Go read the above link first, you dummy!!

Good!! :kissing_heart: So now we are friends.

I can safely assume that you are one of the many proponents of the FIRE movement, and like me you also want to be FI/RE *Financially Independent and Retire Early* .

**Why I started the blog**

There are atleast 10k people who wants to retire early in India. Which is a very small number compared to 800k of the total FI/RE followers.<sup>1</sup>

It is really strange to see that a country which has close to 20% of world population has only 1.2% of total FI/RE population. I believe this to be an opportunity to spread more awareness about FI/RE and let other see a world where life is just not about work, but living too.

Since I started this journey of mine, I have came accross varisous books, blogs, people who have exapnded my way of thinking and has given me a completly new prespective of life. I have learnded so much and still learning and wanted to share this with the world.

**What does this blog about**

As you might judge from the name of the blog, it is obviously about the early retirement, but it's  not limited to that, I also write about other things that surrounds the whole FI/RE buzz.
